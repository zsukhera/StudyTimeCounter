# StudyTimeCounter

This is a weekend C++ and Python project that will help me further improve my studying process.



A 'Control Freak' is a person who likes to take control of themselves and the situations they find themselves in. I have a habit of tracking my daily study times and I did this project to help me understand how my study times have changed over the course of two years. 

I really appreciate my virtual study buddies- Laiba, Muskan, Rabail, and Ayesha - who helped me rack up these hours. :) 

May the grind not go in vain.
